## Create a language

In order to communicate with the car, we have to define **a set of rules** that both we (the iOS device) and the car can understand.

Just imagine you meet a foreigner who doesn't understand English. So you two decide to invent a new language so that you two can understand each other.

Now your car said _"Oh I think the format `<cmd time>` is very comprehensible!"_ and you are like _"Yeah! That's a good idea! Why don't we use `f`, `b`, `l` and `r` as `cmd` and use milliseconds for `time`?"_

But how can we do that technically? It's very easy in Swift. We will use [enum](glossary://enum) to define the specfic set of commands and use the following commands to control the car

    <f2000>        move forward for 2000 milliseconds
    <b1500>        move backward for 1500 milliseconds
    <l500>         turn left for 500 milliseconds
    <r2017>        turn right for 2017 milliseconds

Of course it's just an example. You can set the commands to whatever you like on the car and just don't forget to change it here!

Now you two have a common ground.

But remember that the car don't understand English? Letters like `f` and `b` are still English and the car find it very difficult to recognize the alphabets!

Fortunately, you two both understand a "language"Â¹ named [HEX](glossary://HEX). So you will have to "encode" your command in HEX format and the car will "decode" the command to whatever "language" it used.

_Â¹ Note: HEX isn't really a language._

 1. Play around the code to move your car (it's really easy ðŸ˜œ)!
